## Key Features

1. **Type 1: Basic Power Calculation**
   - ANOVA-based sample size estimates
   - Suitable for cross-sectional studies or comparisons across groups

2. **Type 2: Longitudinal Data Power Calculation**
   - Power estimation for repeated measures and longitudinal data
   - Accounts for time-based dependencies and variability within subjects

3. **Type 3: Covariate-Adjusted Longitudinal Data Power Calculation**
   - Sample size estimates for longitudinal data, with covariate effects removed
   - Ideal for complex studies where confounding factors may impact power
